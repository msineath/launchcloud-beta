# Welcome to LaunchCloud!

### Live site: https://launchcloud.herokuapp.com/

Launch is a soundcloud inspired application for new artists to upload their songs for the public. Each user is able to listen to tracks, have discography information for each song, upload new tracks of their own, as well as like/comment on albums/songs of their choice.

This application uses React for the front-end and Express, postgres/sequelize for the back-end. RESTful API convention is utilized throughout the project as well as adding CRUD operations to the features.
